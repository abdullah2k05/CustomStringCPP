# Custom String Class in C++

This project implements a custom string class in C++ with support for:

✅- Stack and heap memory allocation based on string length.
✅- Copy constructor and assignment operator overloading.
✅- String concatenation using `+` operator.
✅- Input and output stream handling (`>>` and `<<`).
✅- Simple memory management with a 32-character optimization.

## 🔧 Files 📁

- `CustomString.h` – Header file for the `text` class.
- `CustomString.cpp` – Class implementation.
- `main_CustomString.cpp` – Main program to test features.

## 🛠️ Compilation

Use the following command to compile all files together:

```bash
g++ -o customstring main_CustomString.cpp CustomString.cpp
